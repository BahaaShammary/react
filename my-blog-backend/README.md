This project is about creating a fully functioning react application with a 
front end, backend, databse and hosting. 

- This folder contains the back end of the application. 
- Here we handle the requests coming from the front end and making the databse changes accordingly. 
- We set up a MongoDB databse which contains the data for the website in a document.
- Once the database is update depending on the request (GET/POST), then the most  up-to-date data is returned to the client to display the correct info.
- We produce a build for the app, upload it to github, then use that git repo to host the website onto an AWS machine.
