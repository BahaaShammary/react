1. First created the project folder
2. Initialised the folder as an npm package by running `npm init -y`
3. We then installed express `npm install express --save`
4. Created the server.js which acts as the entry point for our project
4. Then install few packages from babel which help in running and compiling javascript
`npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/node @babel/preset-env`
5. Create a file .babelrc - In this file we tell it how to transform our es6 code into common js code 
6. We create our app object, create an endpoint and start the server in server.js then run the command
// We then run our express server by running the command:
`npx babel-node src/server.js`
7. install body parser package to allow server to parse json data

There is an npm package that can sense when we have changed our project and refreshes
'npm install --save-dev nodemon'
To use it, we add to our original project launching command the following: 
npx nodemon --exec npx babel-node src/server.js  

since the command is long, we can add an alias to our package.json for a shorter command.
